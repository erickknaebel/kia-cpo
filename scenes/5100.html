		Meet Maria. Maria came into your dealership shopping a brand new Kia vehicle.
		{11.6}
		While browsing the lot, she discovered a 2-year-old CPO Kia vehicle that is a better fit for her budget.
		{18.6}
		Maria’s current vehicle was purchased used and is now nearly 10 years old.
		{23.2}
		She was considering buying new due to the hassles she experienced with her current vehicle.

        You have completed a well-organized Kia CPO walkaround, but Maria is still quite hesitant on purchasing another pre-owned vehicle.
        {8.7}
        In this simulation, you’ll be presented with several objections from Maria.
        {13.1}
        For each objection, select the BEST possible response.
