			<p>Pre-owned vehicles are all unique and many factors affect their price. That vehicle likely doesn&rsquo;t have the same low mileage or options as this vehicle.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s all about what you&rsquo;re getting for that price. Kia CPO vehicles offer much more value than a non-certified pre-owned.</p>
