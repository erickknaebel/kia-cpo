		Kia&rsquo;s rapidly growing CPO program offers a lot of important benefits for Kia dealerships.
		{5.8}A strong CPO program establishes your dealership as the best place to buy new and used Kia vehicles.
		{13.1}In fact, a strong CPO program helps keep that highly marketable, low-mileage, great condition pre-owned Kia vehicle off your competitor&rsquo;s lots and onto yours.

        {0.3}And that, in turn, brings more customers into your dealership, including a lot of younger, entry-level buyers that you can welcome into the Kia family.
        {8.9}CPO makes sense for your bottom line too.
        {11.8}Industry research has found that CPO vehicles average 41 days to turn, while non-certified used vehicles average 61 days before being sold from your inventory.
        {22.4}And once you earn a CPO sale, you&rsquo;ve got a great customer as part of the deal.
    </div>
    <div id="cc1102">
        {0.6}CPO buyers are more loyal than traditional used or new vehicle buyers and will more often return to your dealership for their next purchase.
        {10.1}They are also more likely to purchase additional F&I products, like extended warranties and service contracts, than traditional used vehicle buyers.
        {18.7}And because CPO buyers have warranties on their vehicle, they are much more likely to return to you for their service and parts needs throughout their ownership period.
