		In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll be given a quick series of statements that belong to either a <span class="nobr">new-vehicle</span> or certified pre-owned vehicle buyer.
		{7.6}Answer each survey question by selecting the group you feel the statement belongs to.
		{12.6}Relax, you&rsquo;re not being graded, just answer with your opinion.
		{16.0}We&rsquo;ll debrief the results when you&rsquo;re done.
		{18.3}Select START to begin.
	</div>
	<div id="cc3110">
		Okay, let&rsquo;s take a look at the results…
		{2.4}
		The first statement is typically true of new-car buyers.
		{5.7}
		They tend to focus on the emotional aspects of a vehicle&rsquo;s styling, having the latest technology, performance and of course, price.
		{14.0}
		With certified pre-owned customers, a vehicle is often more of a need than a want purchase, so they are fittingly more skeptical and practical.
		{22.8}
		They tend to focus on the vehicle&rsquo;s history, its condition and the warranty coverage.
		{28.1}
		Since all new vehicles come with comprehensive warranties, this peace of mind is not as high of a priority for new customers.
	</div>
	<div id="cc3111">
		{1.0}
		Next, CPO customers tend to be more brand loyal than new-car buyers during the shopping process.
		{6.9}
		Once a CPO customer arrives at your dealership, they have likely already decided on a Kia model and simply want to inspect the condition of your specific vehicle.
		{16.2}
		On the other hand, new-vehicle buyers will cross-shop many dealers for the best possible deal.
		{22.9}
		Since new cars are more directly comparable to each other, it is easier for them to drive the price down through dealer competition.
	</div>
	<div id="cc3112">
		{0.8}
		CPO buyers have likely narrowed down their list to just a few select vehicles and are seeking the justification to pay the higher price a CPO vehicle commands.
		{9.8}
		They expect to pay more, but their expectations are also much higher.
		{14.2}
		These customers expect a &ldquo;like-new&rdquo; vehicle and the same level of service a new-car buyer would receive.
		{20.6}
		And, one final thing that both buyers have in common: They are extremely well-informed — performing extensive research online before ever stepping onto your lot.
	</div>
	<div id="cc3113">
		This is why it is critical that you are well-versed on both your product information and Kia CPO&rsquo;s standout features and benefits.
		{8.75}
		In the next module, we&rsquo;ll be taking a closer look at how to weave the impressive benefits and value of Kia CPO throughout the customer experience.
